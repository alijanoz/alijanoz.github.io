        <h2>Why I like to read:</h2>
        <p>I'm a huge fan of reading. I'm surrounded by books all the time, so it's only natural.</p>
        <p>Meoew meoew meow meow meow meow. Meoew meoew meow meow meow meow.Meoew meoew meow meow meow meow.Meoew meoew
            meow meow meow meow. Meoew meoew meow meow meow meow.Meoew meoew meow meow meow meow.Meoew meoew meow meow
            meow meow. Meow meow. Meow mew meow.</p>
        <h2>Here's a joke about cats and reading:</h2>
        <p>I can tell my cat has been reading Joyce's Ulysses because he started saying "Mkgnao."</p>
        <h2>Some more about reading:</h2>
        <p>Fur our final project together, create a website to act as a portfolio for somethwing of yours. It can be fur
            your photography, mewsic, artwork, projects to use fur future job application materials, or--if chu are
            completely stumped on ideas--a portfolio of your codwing projects this semester. Or, if chu'd rafur have a
            sentimental website, (in teh spirit of teh holiday season) feel free to create a family album, a
            commemoration of a place that means somethwing to chu, a map that links between your favorite places, or
            whatefur else chu can think of. Teh goal is to end this class by creatwing somethwing that is useful and/or
            meaningful to chu gowing furward--one that chu can keep and point to so that chu can say "i did that!"</p>
        <p>Create a hyper-linked, multimedia version of your portfolio. Select several different items to act as your
            portfolio "items" and create an html page fur each. Create hyperlinks that join these materials togefur. Chu
            can do so with a table of contents, direct hyperlinks from one item to teh next, narrate and have a user
            click through your explanation of your portfolio items, or so on.</p>
        <p>As we work on hand-codwing with html, develop a base html page to use as a “template”, and copy/paste that to
            use fur each page so chu have a consistent layout and “l00k and feel”. Include one css file that is included
            by all your pages. Include one javascript file that allows fur some kind of user interaction beyond only
            clickwing hyperlinks</p>
        <p>Include multimedia objects to enhance your argumentation. These can be original photographs,
            illustrations, or found multimedia, but if found they must be properly cited and should be somehow
            thematically linked.</p>
